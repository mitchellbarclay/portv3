## FINAL

For my final project I spruced up my arrangement page giving the featured face a body with a shirt that changes colours randomly, as well as background colour changes. I ended up with 16 variables, 13 are continuous variables and 3 are discrete. The continuous variables are used to decide the placement and size of different facial features, while the discrete variables decide the style of hair, facial hair and eye bags. In my final arrangment I made some features rarer than others, for instance bright blue eyes and light blonde hair are rarer than dark eyes and mid brown hair. As well it is more likely that a face has hair than does not, and the most common style of facial hair is clean shaven. I chose to do this with a mix of random focussing, and weighing the slider values so that the chances of landing on one value is more likely than another. I think using a weighted slider allows for more interesting variations as it means that it can favour one end of the spectrum instead of the middle value. 

Overall I really enjoyed this project, I really liked adding variables to the point where I could make surprisingly unique faces in the same art style, and I think I was able to produce something in the spirit of my initial sketches but reinterpretted with p5 primitives. If I was going to do it again I think I would go a bit more interesting with colour and ridiculous features. It could have been interesting if I made some really crazy variables that were more rare.
